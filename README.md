# Kernel recommendations:

### Redmi note 8/8T (*ginkgo*/willow)
- SM6125 -> Recommended to be used on LOS, support in other ROMS is not guaranteed. Non RDP/Non Dynamic ROMs only.

Note: while the kernel doesn't have major modifications, no official support is provided if you're using a different kernel in LOS. DO NOT report bugs while using this kernel.

### Mi A3 (laurel_sprout)

- SM6125 -> Recommended to be used on LOS, support in other ROMS is not guaranteed. Non RDP ROMs only.

Note: while the kernel doesn't have major modifications, no official support is provided if you're using a different kernel in LOS. DO NOT report bugs while using this kernel.

- Snowflake -> Based on NoName, has optimizations over NoName, should work on A15 (not sure about other versions). Non RDP.

- NoName 18.1 -> Recommended for A11-A14 QPR1 ROMs. Non RDP.

- NoName VIC -> Use on RDP roms.

# Kernel Labels:

The kernel label uses the following format:
- `buildDate-deviceName-buildType-kernelVariant-runNumber`
As an example you can see:
- `2025.06.18-MiA3-KSU-SM6125-22.2-148`

### buildDate
The date the kernel was built following the format: `YYYY.MM.DD`.
### deviceName
The name of the device the kernel is built for, like `MiA3`.
### buildType
The type of the build, it can be the following:
- Normal (empty)
- KSU (-KSU)
- RKSU (-RKSU)
- KSUN (-KSUN)

For SUSFS variants, the buildType receives a `.SUSFS` suffix.
### kernelVariant
This is the tag/kernel name, currently these are the tags:
- NoName 18.1 -> NoName-18.1
- NoName VIC -> NoName-VIC
- NoName Snowflake -> Snowflake
- SM6125 23.0 -> SM6125-23.0
### runNumber
Simply the number of the github run, don't use this as a definitive versioning metric, always base yourself on the build date.
